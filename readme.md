# Genetic Programming-assisted Automatic Heuristics Design for Dynamic Vehicle Routing with Drones Considering Time Window

This repository contains the source code for the paper:

**"Genetic Programming-assisted Automatic Heuristics Design for Dynamic Vehicle Routing with Drones Considering Time Window"**

The project proposes a novel framework that leverages genetic programming (GP) to automatically design and optimize heuristics for dynamic vehicle routing problems (DVRP) that integrate drones and adhere to strict time window constraints.

## Overview

In this work, we address the challenges of DVRP with drones by:
- Integrating drone routing with ground vehicle planning.
- Considering delivery time windows.
- Utilizing genetic programming to automatically evolve heuristics tailored for dynamic environments.

The codebase includes:
- A **genetic programming module** that evolves heuristic rules.
- A **simulation environment** that models dynamic routing scenarios.
- **Visualization tools** for analyzing routing performance.
